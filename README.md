## Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics

In this project, I analyze international debt statistics provided by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

This project answers several questions including:
- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
